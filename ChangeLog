	* examples/News/news3.py (Shell.on_ok__clicked): stay on the safe
	side by checking if there is something selected

	method only in BaseView to avoid warnings

	attributes of an instance

	* Kiwi2/initgtk.py (quit_if_last): don't treat hide windows as
	toplevels when seeing if we need to quit because usually there are
	several windows in a glade file.

2005-03-04  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@sicem.biz>

	* Kiwi2/Views.py (SignalBroker): super() only works with new style
	classes

2005-03-03  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@sicem.biz>

	* Kiwi2/List.py (List.add_list): block and unblock the selection signal
	on the selection object instead of the treeview object

	the call from add_list() works
	(List._create_best_renderer_for_type): don't make the cells editable
	until we have a 'editable' property to switch this feature on and off.
	This is needed so we can still double click on the rows

	* Kiwi2/Views.py (GladeSlaveView.__init__): fix some errors so we can
	use this view

	* examples/News/news4.py: new version using a GladeSlaveDelegate with

	scroll window anymore since that functionality is already in the
	KiwiList.

	* examples/News/news3.py: don't use KiwiListDelegate anymore but just
	a simple SlaveDelegate. Also fix the small bug about the color

	* Kiwi2/List.py (KiwiList.__init__): for now, use right click button
	on the header to show the popup menu. Thunderbird style button on top
	of the vertical scrollbar will be done later.

	* examples/News/news3.py: adapt the example to use the new signal

2005-02-21  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@sicem.biz>

	* Kiwi2/AbstractViews.py: we don't use this file anymore. Its contents
	were moved to Views.py
	
	* Kiwi2/__init__.py: put the ValueUnset class here so we avoid
	some cyclic dependencies

	* Kiwi2/Views.py (GladeSignalBroker._connect_glade_signals): make
	AbstractView inherit form GObject so we can enjoy GSignals in the
	views.
	(BaseView.connect): can't proxy these methods anymore because we
	have our own signals now

	* Kiwi2/Delegates.py: added the KiwiListDelegated. Not sure if we
	should deprecate this delegate now that we are pushing all the
	functionality to the Kiwi2.List class.

	* Kiwi2/initgtk.py: we need gobject for signals

	* examples/News/news3.py: 
	* examples/News/news2.py: converted examples to use Kiwi2

	GladeView and GladeSlaveView

	* Kiwi2/initgtk.py (quit_if_last): only see TOPLEVEL windows, no
	POPUPs

	of CList

2005-02-17  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@sicem.biz>

	* Kiwi2/Views.py: forget about GazpachoViews. Make GladeView and
	GladeSlaveView use Gazpacho internally with delegation and don't use
	AbstractGladeView anymore. I still need to implement attach_slave
	with this delegation aproach.

	* Kiwi2/Delegates.py: minor PEP-8 changes and change Kiwi to Kiwi2

	* tests/run_all_tests.py: convenience script to run all of the tests

	* tests/test_BaseViewInherit.py: adapted to run under unittest

	* examples/HeyPlanet/heygazpacho3.py: copy of heygazpacho3.py using

	that?

	* examples/HeyPlanet/heyglade3.py: 
	* examples/HeyPlanet/heyglade2.py: 
	* examples/HeyPlanet/heyglade.py: 
	* examples/HeyPlanet/hey.py: adapted to Kiwi2

	* examples/HeyPlanet/hey.glade: generated by Gazpacho, not Glade-2

2005-02-16  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@sicem.biz>

	* tests/test_BaseView.py: make all the tests run under the unittest
	facilities. Integrate test_BaseView2.py here also.

	* Kiwi2/Views.py (AbstractView._gdk_color_to_string) 
	(AbstractView.get_background, AbstractView.get_foreground): provide
	method to get the colors of a widget in the #XXXXX format
	- Comment out the classes we don't care about right now:
	GladeSlaveView and GladeView

	* Kiwi2/initgtk.py: don't load main_quit, it's deprecated
	(quit_if_last): add this function to be used as a delete-event handler
	so the user can open and close windows without worrying about when
	to call gtk.mainquit

	* Kiwi2/__init__.py (standard_widgets): fixed a bug about not importing
	sys and using sys.stderr

	* Kiwi2/AbstractViews.py (SignalBroker.__init__): refactor SignalBroker
	__init__ method so subclasses can customize it
	(SignalBroker._do_connections): new method that do all the connections
	this signal broker is supposed to make. In the base SignalBroker it
	only calls _autoconnect_by_method_name but in GladeSignalBroker it
	also calls _connect_glade_signals

2005-02-10  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@sicem.biz>

	* Kiwi2/initgtk.py: added explanation on why do we have a separate
	initgtk.py module
