	* Kiwi2/Views.py: implement attach_slave for GazpachoTree and so for
	GladeView and GladeSlaveView

	* Kiwi2/initgtk.py (quit_if_last): only see TOPLEVEL windows, no
	POPUPs

	* examples/News/news.py: adapted to Kiwi2. Also use TreeView instead
	of CList

	* Kiwi2/Views.py: forget about GazpachoViews. Make GladeView and
	GladeSlaveView use Gazpacho internally with delegation and don't use
	AbstractGladeView anymore. I still need to implement attach_slave
	with this delegation aproach.

	* Kiwi2/Delegates.py: minor PEP-8 changes and change Kiwi to Kiwi2

	* tests/run_all_tests.py: convenience script to run all of the tests

	* tests/test_BaseViewInherit.py: adapted to run under unittest

	* examples/HeyPlanet/heygazpacho3.py: copy of heygazpacho3.py using
	Gazpachoview

	* examples/HeyPlanet/heygazpacho2.py: copy of heyglade2.py using
	GazpachoView

	* examples/HeyPlanet/heygazpacho.py: copy of heyglade.py using
	GazpachoView

	* Kiwi2/initgtk.py (quit_if_last): mainquit is deprecated, did you know
	that?

	* examples/HeyPlanet/heyglade3.py: 
	* examples/HeyPlanet/heyglade2.py: 
	* examples/HeyPlanet/heyglade.py: 
	* examples/HeyPlanet/hey.py: adapted to Kiwi2

	* examples/HeyPlanet/hey.glade: generated by Gazpacho, not Glade-2

2005-02-16  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@sicem.biz>

	* tests/test_BaseView.py: make all the tests run under the unittest
	facilities. Integrate test_BaseView2.py here also.

	* Kiwi2/Views.py (AbstractView._gdk_color_to_string) 
	(AbstractView.get_background, AbstractView.get_foreground): provide
	method to get the colors of a widget in the #XXXXX format
	- Comment out the classes we don't care about right now:
	GladeSlaveView and GladeView

	* Kiwi2/initgtk.py: don't load main_quit, it's deprecated
	(quit_if_last): add this function to be used as a delete-event handler
	so the user can open and close windows without worrying about when
	to call gtk.mainquit

2005-02-11  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@sicem.biz>

	* Kiwi2/__init__.py (standard_widgets): fixed a bug about not importing
	sys and using sys.stderr

	* Kiwi2/AbstractViews.py (SignalBroker.__init__): refactor SignalBroker
	__init__ method so subclasses can customize it
	(SignalBroker._do_connections): new method that do all the connections
	this signal broker is supposed to make. In the base SignalBroker it
	only calls _autoconnect_by_method_name but in GladeSignalBroker it
	also calls _connect_glade_signals

2005-02-10  Lorenzo Gil Sanchez  <lgs@sicem.biz>

	* Kiwi2/initgtk.py: added explanation on why do we have a separate
	initgtk.py module

	* setup.py: remove non used imports
