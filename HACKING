Contributing
============

Make sure all unittests pass.
If possible, add a new, or modify an existing test after applying a patch.
Feature requests, bug fixes or added features should be submitted through
bugzilla, http://bugs.async.com.br/enter_bug.cgi?product=Kiwi

Always run pyflakes on the whole source code before submitting, it's important
that pyflakes does not show *ANY* warnings at all. Sometimes you have to
add tiny hacks to workaround bugs in pyflakes.

Try to keep ChangeLog updated

Testsuite
=========

To run the whole testsuite, type:

$ trial tests

in the root directory.

To run a single file, class or test:

$ trial tests.test_datatypes
$ trial tests.test_datatypes.BoolTest
$ trial tests.test_datatypes.BoolTest.testFromString

Coverage
========

Code coverage should generally not increase after checkins, run
the script showcoverage from the tools directory to get a listing of the
current coverage:

$ tools/showcoverage

If you want to see the exact lines, go and dig in _trial_temp/coverage/

It's a little bit broken, so sometimes you have to delete _trial_temp
between runs.

=========
To make it easier to get your patch accepted, follow these steps.

* PEP-8 compatible code
* include test
* does the whole testsuite run
* no pyflakes warnings
