kiwi (1.9.9-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * debian/control:
  - also need to build-dep-indep on python-glade2 (because the doc
    generation wants it) and xfonts-base (Xvfb needs this one because of
    the 'fixed' font); will need a way of import'ing gtk without a
    DISPLAY; anyone? (Closes: #393874)
  * urgency high because it fixes a RC bug

 -- Gustavo Noronha Silva <kov@debian.org>  Thu, 19 Oct 2006 00:12:34 -0300

kiwi (1.9.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/watch:
  - updated watch file for the new download location
  * debian/control:
  - add XS-Python-Version, since vorlon convinced me of its
    importance
  * debian/control, debian/rules, debian/patches/01_avoid_building_howto.diff,
    debian/patches/03_epyrun_use_local_modules.diff,
    debian/python-kiwi.docs, debian/python-kiwi.examples:
  - enable building the API docs and instlaling the examples; the howto is
    not fully buildable from the tarball's contents plus tools
    (Closes: #384159)
  * debian/control, debian/rules:
  - make the API building process run inside a virtual X server, for it
    needs to import GTK+, which really wants a DISPLAY;
  - we need to build-depend on xvfb and xbase-clients for that to work
  * debian/python-kiwi.doc-base.api
  - register API docs in the doc-base system

kiwi (1.9.8-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * debian/preinst:
  - really fix the upgrade problem (Closes: #379359)

 -- Gustavo Noronha Silva <kov@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Jul 2006 23:45:42 -0300

kiwi (1.9.8-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/preinst:
  - added to handle problems in upgrade caused by -4 and earlier being
    built with a python-support version which was buggy when handling
    "outside" modules (Closes: #379359)
  * debian/rules:
  - cleaning up; removing commented code that is not needed anymore
    and remove the code that sed's the python version, for that is done
    by the tools now
  * urgency medium to get the buggy version out of testing soon

 -- Gustavo Noronha Silva <kov@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Jul 2006 23:22:58 -0300

kiwi (1.9.8-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/01_python2.3_install.diff:
  - removed; no longer needed
  * debian/control, debian/rules, debian/pyversions, debian/pycompat:
  - use python-support 0.3 and newer cdbs, that builds using the
    minor version required by the package; also make the build system
    more robust (Closes: #375270)

 -- Gustavo Noronha Silva <kov@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Jun 2006 23:37:54 -0300

kiwi (1.9.8-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/02_avoid_version_checking.diff:
  - don't try to parse the sys.version string; there's no need to check
    for versions inside the script; that's the packaging system's job,
    so simply disabling (Closes: #372660)
  * debian/control, debian/rules:
  - support the new Python Policy (Closes: #373560)
  - update build-deps and deps to have already new-policy-compliant
    packages for python-setuptools and python-gtk2 (Closes: #374505)
  * debian/python-kiwi.{postinst,prerm}, debian/python-support.version:
  - removed; will be created automatically from now on
  * debian/rules:
  - make sure the shebang is modified before the install target is run,
    so dh_python will have python:Depends right

 -- Gustavo Noronha Silva <kov@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jun 2006 20:55:10 -0300

kiwi (1.9.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
  - added dependency on python2.4-setuptools
  * debian/rules:
  - rename the egg-info directory to remove the python version

  - updated; no need to include ez_setup
  * debian/watch:
  - adding new upstream versions monitoring

 -- Gustavo Noronha Silva <kov@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Jun 2006 23:57:18 -0300
